      <p>Hey there! I’m Matt Eller. I’m developing myself into a full stack web developer! This project will serve as my portfolio!</p>
      <p>Instead of finding one site that I think has really great design, I wanted to share one fantastic site I've found to drool over tons of beautifully designed sites called <a href="http://httpster.net/" target="_blank">Httpster</a>! Enjoy!</p>
      <p>The site itself is simple to use, and when I use Chrome Dev tools to look under the hood of the HTML on the home page, it seems to be fairly familiar!</p>
      <p>I also have a <a href="http://mattcjeller.com" target="_blank">personal blog</a> where I'm documenting my progress towards my goal! In addition to blogging about the coolest new things in wed development technologies, I like to share my <a href="http://mattcjeller.com/photography" target="_blank">photography</a>:</p>
